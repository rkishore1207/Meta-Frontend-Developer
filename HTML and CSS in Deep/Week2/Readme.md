* It gives **dynamic control** to the container by shrinking and growing and has two axis.
* The default axis is called **main axis** and opposite to that is called **cross axis**.
* `'align-self'` is the property for individual items in the container.
* Flex has shorthand property: *Flex: grows shrink basis (0 1 auto)*.

* There are two types of units in css are **Absolute and Relative**.
* Absolute is `fixed` and Relative is `in relation` to the Parent.
