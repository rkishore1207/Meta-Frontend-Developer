# Programming with JavaScript
## Week 1
* Installed **Code Runner Extension** in VS code to execute javaScript file and check the output through output window.
* CPU understands `low level` language called machine code (0's and 1's) whereas javascript is a `high level` language (human readable) then compiler cconverts that into `binary code` and make computer understands that.
* JavaScript makes **interactivity** with the websites.
* JS helps to communicate with **Webserver** and updates data **dynamically** (eg,map) and **client-form validation**.
* `Backward Compatible` -> that is develop an application long time ago (past days) and now itself (present) it works perfectly.
* It is the **foundational** technology to develop the frontend and have many uses. We even can communicate to `database` through Javascript.
#### JQuery
* At the time of JavaScript was introduced (Early 2000) there arised one problem also that is Javascript applications are **incompatible** with all browser.
* For every different browser, different javascript codes are needed to execute. 
* To resolve this, javascript applications consume one library named `JQuery`, with the help of jquery js application **can run in all browser** and exists a decade.
* And at 2011, React library swollow everything and use one of best library for javascript.
