# Programming with JavaScript
## Week 1
* Installed **Code Runner Extension** in VS code to execute javaScript file and check the output through output window.
* CPU understands `low level` language called machine code (0's and 1's) whereas javascript is a `high level` language (human readable) then compiler cconverts that into `binary code` and make computer understands that.
* JavaScript makes **interactivity** with the websites.
* JS helps to communicate with **Webserver** and updates data **dynamically** (eg,map) and **client-form validation**.
* `Backward Compatible` -> that is develop an application long time ago (past days) and now itself (present) it works perfectly.
* It is the **foundational** technology to develop the frontend and have many uses. We even can communicate to `database` through Javascript.
