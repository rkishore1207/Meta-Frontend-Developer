# Programming with JavaScript
## Week 2
### Functions in JavaScript
* Why we go for funtion is, we can reuse the piece of code as many time as we want, by just invoking it.
```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(){
    //body of the method
}
//Function Invoking
addTwoNumbers();
```
* And also function is flexible, that is we can execute the function with our desired values,
```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(a,b) //parameters
{
    var result = a+b;
    console.log(result);
}

//invoking
addTwoNumbers(3,5);//arguments
```
