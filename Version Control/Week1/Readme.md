# Version Control
## Week 1
* Version control is a system that records all modifications and changes to files for tracking purpose.
* `Revision history` -> giving the history of code and we can able to **revert and roll back** to the older versions of the code.
* `Identity` -> it signifies that it should show **everyone's name and identity** for their contribution such as he is deleted, he is modified, etc,.
* `Collaboration` -> our team members also can add and modify feature to our team projects and we can utilize the **peer review** that is one can rise the **pull request** to all the peers and everyone needs to check whether that particular piece of code is valid or not and give **approval**.
* `Efficiency` -> Your development team is tasked to develop an app. Your project manager leads you to work in an Agile way of working where tasks are planned and executed in a two-week cycle. This is done to ensure Effieciency.
